This project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with different Word Embeddings and Machine Learning models to allow interaction between the robot and a patient opting for home nursing.

Different classification models are trained on the same dataset before comparing and identifying the best model for the classification task. Subsequently, the best model was utilised to allow conversation between patient and NAO Robot using NLP Chatbot intents by using Visual Code Studio.
